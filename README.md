# Personal-Finance-Management-App

Overview: As a university student, it becomes extremely important to track down our finances and manage our money efficiently. This app has various features to fascilitate personal finance management. 

Features:
This app is divided into three broad categories: 
1. Accounts: This section keeps a track of money present in different accounts you hold. It's broadly categories into 2 groups: Cash account and Bank account. It even allows you to create new account. 
2. Transaction History: As the name suggest, it gives you the history of transactions you have made in a given time period. It also displays amount credited, debited, and net for a given time period. By default it shows the monthly transaction. There is an option for filter which allows you to view transaction for a given category, time period, or an account. 
3. Reports: Reports are again categorised into 2 parts: Income/Expense Statistics and Payable/Receivable reports.
Income/ Expense statistics shows the pie chart of monthly transactions category wise.
Payble/ Receivable report shows a table of net amount to be paid/ received from different parties. This feature is really useful for college students who regualarly lend or borrow money from their friends. 
Last but not least, this app also allows to export our data in the form of excel sheet.

Technology used: Flutter, SQlite, Figma Software
The main aim of this application was that everyone irrespective of the device they use should be able to use the application, hence I decided to work on Flutter.
I want to keep this application offline first, so that even in the absence of internet, people are able to use the application.
